Trying to increase resolution of Mask-RCNN. Doubled the size of the convolution from 28x28 to 56x56. I followed

https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/issues/635

which amounted to basically copying and pasting the Conv2Dtranspose layer in maskrcnn's model.py.

This apparently increases the memory load significantly. I was forced to go from a batch size of 2 to 1 per GPU.
