Trying to increase resolution of Mask-RCNN. Doubled the size of the convolution from 28x28 to 56x56. I followed

https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/issues/635

which amounted to basically copying and pasting the Conv2Dtranspose layer in maskrcnn's model.py.

This apparently increases the memory load significantly. I was forced to go from a batch size of 2 to 1 per GPU.

Installing pycocotools on ubuntu

-> failed to build wheel. Need to upgrade python3.6 to pip install python3.6-dev
-> then pip install pycocotools ... works

Docker stuff : Running an nvidia docker image for deep learning.

$sudo docker image ls

1-$nvidia-docker run --rm nvidia/cuda nvidia-smi
$nvidia-docker run --rm <docker_container_name (eg tensorflow/tensorflow:gpu)> <command>
2-$nvidia-docker run --rm nvidia/cuda nvcc --version
    These commands will guarantee that the GPU has been detected within the container
    
$sudo docker run -it --rm -v /home/NAME/:/tf/ -p 8888:8888 tensorflow/tensorflow:2.0.1-gpu-jupyter bash
