####To see where space is being taken up in Ubuntu.

$du -sh */

will give the memory taken up by each folder in the given directory. This can be used to track down where large files are if your disk space
is being all used up.

/var/lib/docker was using up 800GB causing issues. which was discovered with this command.



#### go into each subdirectory and run a bash command

e.g. $for dir in ~/coco-annotator/datasets/orchidfix/*; do (cd "$dir" && sudo find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -name '*.JPG' -exec exiftran -i -a {} \;); done

->sudo find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -name '*.JPG' -exec exiftran -i -a {} \ ...... was the command I wanted to do in each subdirectory

had an issue with an annotation tool, had to run this command so they were uploaded properly. But all my images were sorted into subdirectories.
