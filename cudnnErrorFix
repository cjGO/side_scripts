 ## Without this line. CudNN was not loaded in properly? Proper Cuda 10.1 + rest was installed on machine at the time.

#From a-mcego

#TENSORFLOW 2.X

-> I have been using the official (nightly)tensorflow nvidia-docker image. Everything appeared correct within the jupyter notebook.
    nvidia-smi, nvcc -V, and test.isgpuavailable were all correct. To make it work, these lines were  required.
    and perhaps some additionall lines, also shown below.

#tf.test.is_gpu_available()
gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
    for gpu in gpus:
        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)
        
 ## ADDITIONAL, maybe necesarry lines
 
 #Doesn't fix TF 2.x
from tensorflow.compat.v1 import ConfigProto
from tensorflow.compat.v1 import InteractiveSession
config = ConfigProto()
config.gpu_options.allow_growth = True
session = InteractiveSession(config=config)
